These are experimental qcustomplot diagrams based on QWidget.

May have to build manually. They will be used, if you start qucs with
$ qucs -a plugins/qcustomplot

A diagram is a QtWidget with a reference to a Diagram (Element) in the
schematic model.

Diagrams don't know about each other, so you may use legacy diagrams instead
(default), if you can make them work with Qt5. They are in ../../legacy.
