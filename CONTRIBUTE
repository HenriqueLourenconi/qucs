Qucs 0.1.* is welcoming contributions.

Currently, the code is in flux in many places while modularising, and porting
to Qt5. This makes it more difficult to contribute, and contributions should
focus on fixing bugs, porting the features present in 0.0.20 and new features
(cf. ROADMAP).

Code contributions that are separate from the existing code base will be
accepted given that they look useful. See README files and code examples in

- examples/plugins
- plugins/*
- legacy/*
- [..]

for further details and instructions. For complicated additions, please contact
the developer(s). Do not submit patches with random changes and patch bombs
against /src.

Your contribution will be distributed under the GNU General Public License v3
or any later version. Please make sure that your code is suitable for this
purpose and state the license where applicable. Please consider the non-free
repository for license incompatible extensions.
