To have CMake pick a Qt installation of your choice that won't be found
automatically, set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable. For example:
"export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/trolltech/qt4.3.5"

You can change the install location by running cmake like this: mkdir build;
cd build cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/new/install/prefix

By default, the prefix is "/usr/local"

Tests are enabled by default. To run the tests, try one of these: make test
env CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 make test    # for verbose output
